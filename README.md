# ActivatingOpenSource

The purpose of ActivatingOpenSource and the associated github repo at https://github.com/codesdk/activatingopensource is to make a humble but meaningful attempt to make it possible for developers to earn a meaningful living by contributing to and supporting open-source projects.

It is a travesty that corporations regularly use open-source projects for their commercial, closed-source apps and backends, but do not give back to the open-source community by supporting the development of open-source libraries and projects, either monetarily or by donating developer time and developer resources.

ActivatingOpenSource and the associated github repo is an attempt to fix this by providing a meaningful way for companies to pay it forward and pay it back by supporting the development and maintenace of the projects that are listed on here

Although OpenCollective has made a sincere attempt to foster the open-source community, it has yet to gain traction.

As such, by providing a directory of resources that enable compensation for developers that contribute their time and energy towards bug-fixing and offering debugging and troubleshooting support through stackoverflow and gitter and slack and github issues, ActivatingOpenSource aims to make a small attempt at fixing the problem of not enough open-source-development-resources and a huge demand for open-source-libraries and projects while security and version issues continue to get neglected.

Please provide your support by creating pull-requests for the repo at https://github.com/codesdk/activatingopensource
